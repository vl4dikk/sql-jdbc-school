Create an application sql-jdbc-school that inserts/updates/deletes data in the database using JDBC.
Use PostgreSQL DB.
Tables (given types are Java types, use SQL analogs that fit the most:
groups(
group_id int,
group_name string
)
students(
student_id int,
group_id int,
first_name string,
last_name string
)
courses(
course_id int,
course_name string,
course_description string
)

Create SQL files with data:
a. create user and database. Assign all privileges on the database to the user. (DB and user should be created before application runs)
b. create a file with tables creation
Create a java application
a. On startup, it should run SQL script with tables creation from previously created files. If tables already exist - drop them.
b. Generate test data:
* 10 groups with randomly generated names. The name should contain 2 characters, hyphen, 2 numbers
* Create 10 courses (math, biology, etc)
* 200 students. Take 20 first names and 20 last names and randomly combine them to generate students.
* Randomly assign students to groups. Each group could contain from 10 to 30 students. It is possible that some groups will be without students or students without groups
* Create relation MANY-TO-MANY between tables STUDENTS and COURSES. Randomly assign from 1 to 3 courses for each student
Write SQL Queries, it should be available from the application menu:
a. Find all groups with less or equals student count
b. Find all students related to course with given name
c. Add new student
d. Delete student by STUDENT_ID
e. Add a student to the course (from a list)
f. Remove the student from one of his or her courses
